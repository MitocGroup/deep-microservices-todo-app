deep-microservices-todomvc is a fully serverless todo-application inspired from [todomvc.com][1].
Frontend part is built on top of [Angular-CLI][2], but backend is cloud-native and is managed by [DEEP Framework][3]. 
This repository is open sourced to show case how developers can build and deploy hassle-free cloud-native
web applications using microservices architecture and serverless computing.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure that you have [proper software][4] installed

## Getting Started

1. Clone repository
2. Go to `src/deep-todomvc` directory
3. Prepare backend by running `npm run prepare-backend`
4. Prepare frontend by running `npm run prepare-frontend`
5. Go back to `src` directory
6. Run Microservice in Development mode

```bash
deepify server ./
```

 * During this step configure your `frontend/backend` parameters, set `runAsApi` to `true` in order to be able to use 
`ng-cli` for frontend development;

 * When this step is finished, 
    * And `runAsApi=false` just open in your browser the link [*http://localhost:8000*][5]
    * And `runAsApi=true` go to `src/deep-todomvc/frontend` and run `npm run start` and go [*http://localhost:4200*][6]
 * Enjoy the deep-microservices-todomvc running locally.

7. Deploy Microservice to Production

After your development work is done just run (from `src` directory):

 * Compile backend: `deepify compile prod`
 * Deploy the application: `deepify deploy`

> Amazon CloudFront distribution takes up to 20 minutes to provision, therefore donâ€™t worry
if it returns an HTTP error in the first couple of minutes.

8. Remove Microservice from Production

In case if you want to undeploy this AWSome ;) application, just run (from `src` directory):

```bash
deepify undeploy 
```

> Amazon CloudFront distribution takes up to 20 minutes to unprovision. That's why `deepify`
command checks every 30 seconds if it's disabled and when successful, removes it from your account.
